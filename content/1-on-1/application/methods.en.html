<br></p>
<p><strong>Tips for this assessment method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the assessment will also be taken by other students (e.g. at a different time), present the questions in random order to prevent the sharing of answers.</p></li>
<li><p>Live proctoring is quite feasible in the case of individual assessments.</p></li>
<li><p>In the case of open-ended questions, set a limit on the number of words, for exaple, or what the answer should include, to prevent long-winded answers.</p></li>

<p><strong>Tips for this assessment method</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assessing presentations, projects or products can be very time-consuming, and may therefore not seem to be an obvious choice at this scale. However, the assessment in a formative setting can be made easier by dividing students into groups and/or implementing peer feedback, in which students assess one another’s work. It may also help to have students record their presentations, so that you can assess them at a more suitable time and location.</p></li>
<li><p>If the examiner does not know a student, ask the student to hold up their ID card or student card to show who they are.</p></li>

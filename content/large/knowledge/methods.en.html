<p><strong>Tips for this assessment method</strong></p>
<p>*If the group of students is too large to be able to use lots of open-ended questions, you could use closed-ended questions with automatic marking. Examples are multiple choice questions, drag-and-drop questions or short essay questions. Note however that this makes it even more important to ensure that students cannot cheat.</p>
<p>*In the case of open-ended questions, set a limit on the number of words, for exaple, or what the answer should include, to prevent long-winded answers.</p>
<p>*If live proctoring is required, split the students into groups so that an examiner can be present in each breakout room.</p>

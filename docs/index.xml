      <description>Appropriate 1-on-1 supervision depends on a range of factors, including the subject matter, content complexity, course level and the level of student’s independence. This also affects the type of activities to provide them with feedback and support, assess student’s progress and their final level. Typically assessment formats include a thesis, field report, oral presentation, or oral exam. Your department likely has a well-documented procedure for the assignment requirements and associated rubric for grading, so be sure to have that in-hand from the beginning.</description>

      <description>Online teaching requires more effort to stay connected to your students. In addition, students may feel disconnecting to the university, the program, and their fellow students. Students may experience different kinds of issues like lack of facilities, stamina, or social competencies to thrive in an online learning environment. Organising short Live Chat sessions or opening up a Discussion Board and responding on set times, helps to increase the sense of belonging, support and your accessibility to your students.</description>

      <description>Learning to the test is common practice in student behavior (and human behavior). If that’s the case, it’s important to have the test meet your standards. At the same time, online practices require additional trustworthy procedures for both you, your students and the institution. Always contact your faculty’s ICTO support staff for more information about assessment tools (specifically for exams) available at your faculty. The ICTO team helps you in making the right technical choices and provides support before and during exams.</description>

      <description>Learning to the test is common practice in student behavior (and human behavior). If that’s the case, it’s important to have the test meet your standards. At the same time, online practices require additional trustworthy procedures for both you, your students and the institution. Always contact your faculty’s ICTO support staff for more information about assessment tools (specifically for exams) available at your faculty. The ICTO team helps you in making the right technical choices and provides support before and during exams.</description>

      <description>Add a personal start of the week (video) message with Kaltura in Canvas to announce the topics of the week and address (upvoted) questions based on the Discussion Board. This can be a way to quickly address all issues and personalize your interaction with more students at once. Provide a Zoom office session or a Canvas Live Chat shortly after a lecture, seminar or workgroup. Students are often still in a learning mode and may have questions they don’t want to address in the general Zoom session (like in an offline setting).</description>

      <description>Peer-feedback increases the amount of feedback for students. Sidenote, it often doesn’t save the lecturer time as he/she has a different role to fulfill; providing feedback on the peer-feedback. If you leave out this part, students often tend to underestimate the value of peerfeedback and perceive it as ineffective additional work. A plenary Zoom session or pre-recorded video to discuss the best feedback and your general view on the products (main mistakes, issues, things to attend), helps to overcome these issues.</description>

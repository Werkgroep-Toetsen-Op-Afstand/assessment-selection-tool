      <description>Appropriate assessment formats depend on a range of factors, including the subject matter, content complexity, course level and the number of students enrolled. Typically, they include essays, reports, presentations, skills tests, open-ended or multiple choice exams. We recommend that you review our Assessments Documentation to learn more about the digital varieties for each of the assignment and assessment options, and then determine what is most appropriate for your course. Here, you can also find information on when to run changes by your exam committee and how/when to get your ICTO support team involved.</description>

      <description>Typically, group results are presented in class presentations, group reports or other collaborative products.
LIVE GROUP PRESENTATIONS  Provide or pre-record (with PowerPoint) your instructions for a live group presentation session and upload this to Canvas. You can explain how the live session is structured, what you expect students to do, and how the grading procedure works. Set up your grading rubrics in Canvas SpeedGrader. Schedule a live Zoom session of max 90 minutes in Canvas.</description>

      <description>Record a one-on-one interview using Zoom. Aim for a maximum interview of 30-45 minutes. If possible, cut the recording in segments based on (sub)topics of 15 min max. Upload the interview to Canvas for viewing as part of structured self-study. Add clear instructions for your students. For example, indicate when students should watch it, add a question, what to look for and/or and what they should be able to do or know afterwards.</description>

      <description>Appropriate assignments depend on a range of factors, including the subject matter, content complexity, course level and the number of students enrolled. There are many options to consider, such as short response papers, quizzes, adjusted field work and problem solving assignments. The same goes for assessment formats. Typically, they include essays, reports, presentations, skills tests, open-ended or multiple choice exams. We recommend that you review our Assessments Documentation to learn more about the digital varieties for each of the assignment and assessment options, and then determine what is most appropriate for your course.</description>

      <description>Provide students with lectures for viewing on Canvas. You have two options here: pre-recorded or new recording. Choose pre-recorded (i.e., using existing recordings from lecture hall) if the technical quality is good enough and if the content still meets your goal. Otherwise, opt for a new recording. For both, you want to focus on smaller segments as opposed to one lengthy video. Aim for a maximum of 15-minutes per video and 45 minutes of total content to replace a 2-hour lecture.</description>

      <description>Schedule a weekly Canvas Live-Chat session of 30-45 min for students to raise questions. Students can then review the questions and answers of other students too. This can be tricky if you have MANY students trying to ask questions at the same time, in which you might set up 2 x 25 minutes sessions with half students assigned to each session; or if available, you might opt to do this separately by smaller workgroups.</description>

      <description>Your options here are either a mixed (pre-recorded + live) or completely live seminar. Your decision is best made on the basis of your own personal style and the content you are working with. In general, we recommend the mixed approach so that your live portions capitalize on opportunities for student engagement and interaction. In both cases, we aim for a total of 90-minutes of content time (plus breaks).
MIXED APPROACH  Pre-record content with Powerpoint (15 minutes).</description>

 Pre-record your instructions and short presentation with Powerpoint (10 minutes). Upload this to Canvas for students to view prior to the seminar. You can also explain what you expect students to do in the breakout rooms and what they should deliver at the end (they canâ€™t see your instructional slides in a breakout room).</description>

      <description>Learning to the test is common practice in student behavior (and human behavior). If thatâ€™s the case, itâ€™s important to have the test meet your standards. At the same time, online practices require additional trustworthy procedures for both you, your students and the institution. Always contact your facultyâ€™s ICTO support staff for more information about assessment tools (specifically for exams) available at your faculty. The ICTO team helps you in making the right technical choices and provides support before and during exams.</description>

      <description>LIVE GROUP PRESENTATION Live sessions help your students to stay connected to the course and each other. But, attending online live sessions takes up a lot of the participantsâ€™ energy, including your own. Therefore, your online sessions are shorter and with more breaks in between than in an offline setting. By preparing a rubric using SpeedGrader you can instantly assess your students in an efficient manner and students get their â€˜just-in-time-feedbackâ€™.</description>

      <description>With large groups, a live Zoom session is less feasible. Students might encounter technical problems which prevent them from (completely) following a live session and there are limits to the number of students that can participate in a Zoom-session. Therefore pre-recorded lectures are the way to go.
Ideally, your students watch the (full) interview in a â€˜learning modeâ€™ (active processing) instead of a â€˜watching tv modeâ€™ (passive processing). This may take up a lot of your studentsâ€™ energy.</description>

      <description>Clear assignments with useful feedback during a course are one of the most effective educational tools you have to teach your students. In both online and offline settings, assignments with feedback 1) provide an opportunity for your students to practice and to process the subject matter (studentsâ€™ learning), 2) help your students to determine whether they are on track or should adjust what and how they are studying (studentsâ€™ self-regulation), and 3) provide you with necessary information on your studentsâ€™ understanding, progress and content related difficulties (teaching regulation).</description>

      <description>Online teaching requires more effort to stay connected to your students. In addition, students may feel disconnecting to the university, the program, and their fellow students. Students may experience different kinds of issues like lack of facilities, stamina, or social competencies to thrive in an online learning environment. Organising short Live Chat sessions or opening up a Discussion Board and responding on set times, helps to increase the sense of belonging, support and your accessibility to your students.</description>

      <description>The mixed option (our preferred approach) ensures that you donâ€™t have to spend much time on instruction during the live session in Zoom and, instead, students can spend more time working on an assignment in the breakout rooms. But, if you want to explain (more) subject matter in an interactive way, then definitely go the complete Live approach.
Breakout Rooms can be very effective to engage, practice, discuss, and collaborate in subgroups.</description>

Breakout Rooms can be very effective to engage, practice, discuss, and collaborate in subgroups. As with offline settings, you can visit each group to see how they are doing and to make sure they are still on task.</description>

      <description>Peer-feedback increases the amount of feedback for students. Sidenote, it often doesnâ€™t save the lecturer time as he/she has a different role to fulfill; providing feedback on the peer-feedback. If you leave out this part, students often tend to underestimate the value of peerfeedback and perceive it as ineffective additional work. A plenary Zoom session or pre-recorded video to discuss the best feedback and your general view on the products (main mistakes, issues, things to attend), helps to overcome these issues.</description>

      <description>Live Presentations: Take advantage of the online setting to increase student engagement and peer feedback. Let students provide one compliment, one suggestion for improvement, and/or one question in the chat after each presentation. Live Presentations: Assign student roles to generate questions and lead a discussion after a few presentations. Use the SpeedGrader audio feedback tool in Canvas. For each student, you can record an audio message with the main feedback point.</description>

      <description>Add a cliff-hanger to the first interview. For example, if your guest has a real life example, donâ€™t tell the end of the story until the second interview. Add a short quiz to your video with Feedback Fruits. For example, to assess studentsâ€™ understanding of the subject matter, to have your guest raise a question, or to have students think about what they would do in a real life example before your guest continues a story.</description>

      <description>If you have more students working on the same individual assignments, consider adding peer-feedback with Feedback Fruits. Peer-feedback increases the amount of feedback for students. Sidenote, it often doesnâ€™t save the lecturer time as he/she has a different role to fulfill; providing feedback on the peer-feedback. If you leave out this part, students often tend to underestimate the value of peerfeedback and perceive it as ineffective additional work.

      <description>Add a short quiz to your video with Feedback Fruits to assess studentsâ€™ understanding of the subject matter. This way you activate your students while they watch your videos and foster information processing. Plus, you finally get feedback on what students (mis)understand. Add a personal start of the week (video) message with Kaltura in Canvas in which you announce the topics of the week and link it to the previous week.</description>

      <description> Add a personal start of the week (video) message with Kaltura in Canvas to announce the topics of the week and address (upvoted) questions based on the Discussion Board. Especially with large groups, this can be a way to quickly address all issues and personalize your interaction with many students at once.  </description>

      <description>Add a personal start of the week (video) message with Kaltura in Canvas in which you announce this weekâ€™s seminar and link it to the previous week. You can also use this to address questions posted by students on Canvas after the last seminar. Add teaching assistants to supervise the breakout rooms and increase the hands-on feedback. Add individual practical assignments prior to the Zoom session (student self-study), so students can compare, share and discuss their findings in the Breakout Rooms.</description>
